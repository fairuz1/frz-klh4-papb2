    <string name="article1">Many a Beatle fanatic started down the outtake
        road,
        like I did, with a first listen to this song. Originally titled “Beatle Bop” and recorded in a single session that yielded four songs (the other three featured Tony Sheridan with the Beatles as a backing band), “Cry for a Shadow” is an instrumental written by Lennon and Harrison, which makes it unique to this day. John Lennon plays rhythm guitar, George Harrison plays lead guitar, Paul McCartney plays bass, and Pete Best plays drums. The sessions were produced by Bert Kaempfert in Hamburg, Germany, during the Beatles’ second visit from April through July of 1961 to play in the Reeperbahn-section clubs.</string>

    <string name="vespa98_descriptions1">The Vespa 98 was the first serially built Vespa from Piaggio. It was built between 1946 and 1947 and was divided into four series: V.98/1 and V.98/2 and from 1947 on V.98/3 and V.98/4, with minor modifications.</string>
    <string name="vespa98_descriptions2">The basis for the first model were the prototypes Paperino (or MP5) and MP6 by Corradino D\'Ascanio and Enrico Piaggio. An essential feature was the free passage, which is still maintained today. The V98 has a 98 cc engine, a three-speed gearbox and a top speed of 60 km/h. The leg shield is evenly curved. There is no main stand and for parking it is leaned on an outrigger that protrudes from the rear footboard on the left and right.</string>
