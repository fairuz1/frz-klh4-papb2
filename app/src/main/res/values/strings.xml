    <string name="vespa98_descriptions1">The Vespa 98 was the first serially built Vespa from Piaggio. It was built between 1946 and 1947 and was divided into four series: V.98/1 and V.98/2 and from 1947 on V.98/3 and V.98/4, with minor modifications.</string>
    <string name="vespa98_descriptions2">The basis for the first model were the prototypes Paperino (or MP5) and MP6 by Corradino D\'Ascanio and Enrico Piaggio. An essential feature was the free passage, which is still maintained today. The V98 has a 98 cc engine, a three-speed gearbox and a top speed of 60 km/h. The leg shield is evenly curved. There is no main stand and for parking it is leaned on an outrigger that protrudes from the rear footboard on the left and right.</string>
